# rails-ticket-app

Co-project between Mel and Josh.
The plan is to create a ticketing app with a back end just for promoters ie clients.tickets.com.  Here they can create events and other functionality.  They will then be deployed to tickets.com which is a stylised front end for customers wishing to purchase a ticket.
